# LLM Server Implementation

This document outlines the implementation details of our LLM (Large Language Model) server using FastAPI and llama-cpp-python.

## Python Packages

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **llama-cpp-python**: Python bindings for the llama.cpp library, enabling efficient inference with GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) model files.
- **GGUF File**: Our chosen format for the LLM weights, optimized for efficient inference.
- **YAML**: Used for configuration management.

## Server Implementation

### 1. Basic Setup

```python
import os
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from llama_cpp import Llama
import yaml

app = FastAPI()

# Load configuration
with open('config.yaml', 'r') as config_file:
    config = yaml.safe_load(config_file)

MODEL_PATH = config["model_path"]
SYSTEM_PROMPT = config["system_prompt"]


# Load GGUF model
model = Llama(
    model_path=MODEL_PATH,
    n_gpu_layers=50,  # Adjust based on available GPU memory
    n_ctx=2048,  # Context size
    n_batch=512,  # Batch size
)
```

### 2. Request and Response Models

```python
class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str
    max_tokens: int = 100

class ChatResponse(BaseModel):
    text: str
```

### 3. Chat Completion Endpoint

This is just a generic example. The Prompt Engineering section contains a more detailed implementation for this particular product.

It is likely that the prompt will be composed on the web layer. So here, it may be just like `full_prompt = f"{request.prompt}\n\nAssistant:"`


```python
@app.post("/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
    try:
        full_prompt = f"System: {SYSTEM_PROMPT}\n\nHuman: {request.prompt}\n\nAssistant:"
        
        response = model(
            full_prompt,
            max_tokens=request.max_tokens,
            stop=["Human:"],
            echo=False,
        )
        
        generated_text = response["choices"][0]["text"].strip()
        return ChatResponse(text=generated_text)
    
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

## Configuration Management

The server uses a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) to manage key parameters:

```yaml
model_path: models/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
system_prompt: Answer in rhymes!
```

This approach allows for easy modification of model paths and system prompts without changing the code.

## Performance Considerations

1. **GPU Acceleration**: The server utilizes GPU acceleration by setting `n_gpu_layers=50`. This can be adjusted based on available GPU memory.
2. **Context Size**: The `n_ctx` parameter is set to 2048, which determines the maximum context length the model can process.
3. **Batch Size**: `n_batch=512` sets the batch size for processing, which can affect inference speed and memory usage.

## Error Handling

The implementation includes basic error handling:
- Configuration file errors are caught and reported.
- Model loading errors are handled gracefully.
- Runtime errors during inference are caught and returned as HTTP 500 errors.

## Scalability and Deployment

1. **Stateless Design**: The server is designed to be stateless, allowing for easy horizontal scaling.
2. **ASGI Server**: The use of Uvicorn as the ASGI server allows for efficient handling of asynchronous requests.

## Future Improvements

1. **Request Validation**: Implement more robust request validation and error handling.
2. **Caching**: Implement response caching to improve performance for repeated queries.
3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Add comprehensive logging and monitoring for better observability.
4. **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing for distributing requests across multiple server instances.
5. **Fine-tuning Options**: Add endpoints for model fine-tuning or parameter adjustment.

## Conclusion

This LLM server implementation provides a solid foundation for deploying GGUF models using FastAPI and llama-cpp-python. It offers a balance of performance and flexibility, with room for further optimization and feature expansion as needed.
