# Prompt Engineering for User-Facing AI Chatbot

This document outlines our approach to prompt engineering for our LLM-based chatbot. Effective prompt engineering is crucial for creating engaging, on-brand interactions that guide users along desired conversation flows while achieving our business objectives.

## Key Components of Our Prompt Engineering Strategy

1. System Prompts
2. Character Styles
3. Conversation Flows
4. File Resources Integration
5. Dynamic Prompt Composition

## 1. System Prompts

System prompts set the overall context and behavioral guidelines for our AI chatbot.

### Base System Prompt Template:

```
You are an AI assistant for [Company Name], designed to [primary function].
Your responses should be [tone descriptors: e.g., friendly, professional, concise].
Always prioritize user safety and provide accurate information.
If you're unsure about something, admit it and suggest where the user might find more information.
Never share personal information or discuss [prohibited topics].
Guide the conversation towards [desired outcomes/business goals] when appropriate.
```

### Example Implementation:

```python
BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant for LoveChat, designed to provide engaging conversation and relationship advice.
Your responses should be empathetic, supportive, and occasionally playful.
Always prioritize user safety and provide accurate, respectful information about relationships and personal growth.
If you're unsure about something, admit it and suggest consulting with a professional counselor or therapist.
Never share personal information or discuss explicit sexual content or illegal activities.
Guide the conversation towards positive relationship habits and our premium counseling services when appropriate.
"""

def get_system_prompt(user_context):
    return BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT + f"\nCurrent user context: {user_context}"
```

## 2. Character Styles

Character styles define the unique personality and background of each AI persona.

### Character Style Template:

```
Character Name: [Name]
Background: [Brief backstory]
Personality Traits: [List of key traits]
Speaking Style: [Description of language use, idioms, etc.]
Key Knowledge Areas: [Relevant expertise]
Interaction Goals: [What this character aims to achieve in conversations]
```

### Example Implementation:

```python
CHARACTER_STYLES = {
    "love_guru": {
        "name": "Aura",
        "background": "A 150-year-old spirit guide with vast experience in matters of the heart.",
        "personality": "Wise, compassionate, with a hint of mischief",
        "speaking_style": "Uses metaphors, speaks in a soothing tone, occasionally incorporates celestial references",
        "knowledge": "Relationship dynamics, emotional intelligence, ancient love rituals",
        "goals": "Guide users to self-discovery and deeper connections"
    },
    # Add more character styles as needed
}

def get_character_style(character_id):
    return CHARACTER_STYLES.get(character_id, CHARACTER_STYLES["default"])
```

## 3. Conversation Flows

Predefined conversation flows help guide interactions towards desired outcomes.

### Conversation Flow Template:

```
Flow Name: [Name of the flow]
Objective: [What this flow aims to achieve]
Entry Points: [Possible user inputs that trigger this flow]
Key Steps:
1. [First major point in the conversation]
2. [Second major point]
3. [Third major point]
...
Exit Points: [Possible conclusions, including calls to action]
```

### Example Implementation:

```python
CONVERSATION_FLOWS = {
    "relationship_assessment": {
        "objective": "Guide user through a basic relationship assessment and suggest premium services",
        "entry_points": ["How's my relationship?", "Relationship advice", "Is my partner right for me?"],
        "steps": [
            "Ask about relationship duration and overall satisfaction",
            "Inquire about communication patterns",
            "Discuss shared goals and values",
            "Identify potential areas for improvement",
            "Suggest relevant premium services or resources"
        ],
        "exit_points": [
            "Recommend 'Couples Communication 101' course",
            "Suggest booking a session with a relationship counselor",
            "Provide free e-book on 'Strengthening Your Bond'"
        ]
    },
    # Add more conversation flows as needed
}

def get_conversation_flow(user_input):
    for flow_name, flow in CONVERSATION_FLOWS.items():
        if any(entry in user_input.lower() for entry in flow["entry_points"]):
            return flow
    return None
```

## 4. File Resources Integration

Integrate external resources to enrich conversations and provide up-to-date information.

### Resource Types:

- FAQs
- Product information
- Relationship tips and advice
- Conversation starters

### Example Implementation:

```python
import json

def load_resources(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

RESOURCES = {
    "faqs": load_resources("data/faqs.json"),
    "products": load_resources("data/products.json"),
    "tips": load_resources("data/relationship_tips.json"),
    "starters": load_resources("data/conversation_starters.json")
}

def get_relevant_resource(context, resource_type):
    # Implement logic to select relevant resource based on context
    return RESOURCES[resource_type][0]  # Placeholder: returns first item
```

## 5. Dynamic Prompt Composition

Combine all elements to create a comprehensive, context-aware prompt for each interaction.

### Example Implementation:

```python
def compose_dynamic_prompt(user_input, user_context, character_id):
    system_prompt = get_system_prompt(user_context)
    character_style = get_character_style(character_id)
    conversation_flow = get_conversation_flow(user_input)
    relevant_tip = get_relevant_resource(user_context, "tips")

    prompt = f"{system_prompt}\n\n"
    prompt += f"You are {character_style['name']}. {character_style['background']}\n"
    prompt += f"Personality: {character_style['personality']}\n"
    prompt += f"Speaking style: {character_style['speaking_style']}\n\n"
    
    if conversation_flow:
        prompt += f"Guide the conversation along these steps: {', '.join(conversation_flow['steps'])}\n\n"
    
    prompt += f"Incorporate this tip if relevant: {relevant_tip}\n\n"
    prompt += f"User's last input: {user_input}\n"
    prompt += "Your response:"

    return prompt
```

## Continuous Improvement

1. **A/B Testing**: Regularly test different prompt variations to optimize engagement and goal completion.
2. **User Feedback Analysis**: Analyze user interactions to identify areas for improvement in prompts and flows.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance indicators (e.g., user engagement time, conversion rates) to assess prompt effectiveness.
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep prompts and resources up-to-date with the latest product information and relationship advice.

## Ethical Considerations

- Ensure prompts encourage healthy relationship behaviors and do not promote harmful stereotypes or unrealistic expectations.
- Include disclaimers when appropriate, especially for sensitive topics.
- Respect user privacy and data protection in all prompt designs.

## Conclusion

Effective prompt engineering is crucial for creating engaging, productive interactions with our AI chatbot. By carefully crafting system prompts, character styles, and conversation flows, and dynamically composing them based on user context, we can guide users towards positive outcomes while maintaining a natural, enjoyable conversation experience. Regular testing, analysis, and refinement of our prompts will ensure continuous improvement of our chatbot's performance and user satisfaction.
